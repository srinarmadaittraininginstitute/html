		<p align="justify">Angular is mainly used to create "data bindings".  We establish relation between a property and html element. When the value of property is changed, the same will be automatically effected in the corresponding html element, and vice versa. So that the developer need not write  any code for DOM manipulation. Thus the developer can fully concentrate on the application logic, instead of write huge code for DOM manipulations. So we can achieve clean separation between application logic and "DOM manipulations".</p>
